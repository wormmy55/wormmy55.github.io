        "This exercise consists of four parts: <br><br>\n",
        "  1.\tWrite a function to download a single file. This function will take two arguments: the url of the file (in this case an image from bing) and the pathname (the name of the downloaded file). You will use the request library to do this.<br>\n",
        "  To indicate to the user that the program is alive, you should display the name of the resulting file on the console.<br><br>\n",
        "  2.\tSecond is to write a function to invoke the above function to download a set of images sequentially. That implies that this function will send the appropriate arguments to the above function. The urls are listed below.<br><br>\n",
        "  3.\tThird is to write a function to download the same set of images using threads. You will measure the time taken for both downloads to decide if there is any advantage of using threads.<br><br>\n",
        "  4.\tWrite the logic to check if the script is being executed, if it is, it checks for the command line arguments and process them appropriately and then runs the program accordingly.<br><br>\n",
        "Please download your images to a separate folder so, you can delete the entire folder afterwards.<br>\n",
