Exercise 2: Facial Recognition for Differentiating Specific Features â€“ Using CNNs

Using TensorFlow, design and develop a CNN model for differentiating people with mask and those without mask. 
Use the dataset of images uploaded on the Assignment 3 folder. 
Follow the steps given in the referenced article also uploaded on the Assignment 3 folder. 

Analyze the accuracy of the model and point out some of the pitfalls.

Your output should display the results of image classification in a friendly format.

Algorithm 1: Face Mask detection

Input: Dataset including faces with and without masks
Output: Categorized image depicting the presence of face mask
FOR each image in the dataset DO
    Visualize the image in 2 categories and label them
    Convert the RGB image to Gray-scale image
    Resize the gray-scale image into 100 x 100
    Normalize the image and convert it into 4 dimensional array
END
FOR building the CNN model DO
    Add a Convolution layer of 200 filters
    Add the second Convolution layer of 100 filters
    Insert a Flatten layer to the network classifier
    Add a Dense layer of 64 neurons
    Add the final Dense layer with 2 outputs for 2 categories
END
Split the data and train the model
